# Coding with Friends 2020

I learned a lot doing this with Coding with Friends. I found that I just don't have the time! Having a toddler in my life and working a full time job means I just don't have the time and bandwith to work on major projects at a set speed. Though setting aside some serious time to work on the code a bit every day. Even if just a bit while watching tv was great

The first few weeks of the month I spent training on Flutter technologies, so I didn't get started with the coding for a long time.

I also really enjoyed the group I was assigned to for encuragment, though it went pretty quiet half way through thw month.

I definitally didn't finish, and really didn't get far, but I got a ton of documentation and training to move forward with. Very excited to continue!
